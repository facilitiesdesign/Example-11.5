# Example-11.5

Consider Example 11.4. Assuming the layout has a central corridor of width 5 meters with offices on either side of it, and the restrictions on department sizes as shown in Table 11.2, develop a block plan using the LP model presented in Section 11.6.3. Assume that departments 2, 3, and 4 are in the top row in that order from left to right and departments 1 and 5 are in the bottom row.
